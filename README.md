Business Understanding

Spotify is a music streaming service that goes the extra mile to recommend the next song according to your listening history. In this analysis I will be using a dataset provided by them to answer what attributes makes a song more danceable. 

Data Understanding

Danceability describes how suitable a track is for dancing based on a combination of musical elements including tempo, rhythm stability, beat strength, and overall regularity. A value of 0.0 is least danceable and 1.0 is most danceable.
Speechiness detects the presence of spoken words in a track. The more exclusively speech-like the recording (e.g. talk show, audio book, poetry), the closer to 1.0 the attribute value. Values above 0.66 describe tracks that are probably made entirely of spoken words. Values between 0.33 and 0.66 describe tracks that may contain both music and speech, either in sections or layered, including such cases as rap music. Values below 0.33 most likely represent music and other non-speech-like tracks.
Valence is a measure from 0.0 to 1.0 describing the musical positiveness conveyed by a track. Tracks with high valence sound more positive (e.g. happy, cheerful, euphoric), while tracks with low valence sound more negative (e.g. sad, depressed, angry).

Data Preparation

How does a song's use of positive or negative melody impact a songs attractiveness for danceability?
How does more spoken word use impact a songs danceability? 
What is the proportion of positive or negative melody in the songs and who is the artist of these songs?

Evaluate the Results
There is a greater chance that someone will get up and move to a song based on a more positive melody, more instrumental  and a minimal use of words.
